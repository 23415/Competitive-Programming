1. Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name.

2. Modify the previous program (i.e. Q.1) such that only the users Alice and Bob are greeted with their names.

3. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n

4. Modify the previous program (i.e. Q.3) such that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum, e.g. 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15 for n=17

5. Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n.

6. Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12.

7. Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 2 numbers. 

8. Write a program that prints the next 20 leap years.

9. Write a function that returns the largest element in a array.

10. Write a function that checks whether an element occurs in a array.

11. Write a function that returns the elements on odd positions in a list.

12. Write three functions that compute the sum of the numbers in a array: using a for-loop, a while-loop and recursion.

13. Write a function that concatenates two arrays. [a,b,c], [1,2,3] → [a,b,c,1,2,3]

14. Write a function that merges two sorted into a new sorted list. [1,4,6],[2,3,5] → [1,2,3,4,5,6]. You can do this quicker than concatenating them followed by a sort.

15. Write a function that computes the list of the first n Fibonacci numbers. The first two Fibonacci numbers are 1 and 1. The n+1-st Fibonacci number can be computed by adding the 
n-th and the n-1-th Fibonacci number. The first few are therefore 1, 1, 1+1=2, 1+2=3, 2+3=5, 3+5=8.

16. Write a function that return the Factorial of given number n.

17. Print the following pattern without using print in-built function.
i.      ii.     iii.
***     123     321
***     123     321
***     123     321

18. Convert i. Minutes -> Seconds 
            ii. Fahrenheit -> Celsius -> Kelvin

19. Design a quiz game which take answer as input to given question (atleast 5) and print final result(Total marks & percentage). +2 for Correct answer, -0.5 for Incorrect.

20. Design a tool which find area & perimeter of different shapes.

21. Return first, middle & last element of array.

22.
